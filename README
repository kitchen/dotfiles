kitchen's dotfiles

run `make` to install

this doesn't do any checking to make sure things are correctly symlinked so if there are files already there it won't do the needful. I'd like to fix that. Perhaps instead of using `make` I'll use something like ansible, though I don't much care for adding that as a dependency
