kitchen's dotfiles

I'm now using [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles. Or at least trying to. This is an experiment. So far I really only have 3 things I have my dotfiles on anymore and they all support `stow`, so that's good.

run `bash install.sh` and delete things as it whines about them. It's not a smooth transition process, but that's fine. I don't care.
